        <p>On page optimization refers to all measures taken by SEOs within the website to improve the ranking of a site in search engine result pages. These measures are related to content and HTML source code of a page, e.g., meta tags, keyword placement, and keyword density including the technical set-up, the content, and user-friendliness of your site. So, on page seo optimization factors are linked with the elements of your website.</p>
        <p>So, in on page seo, you deal with all the elements of SEO that you can control.

        <div>
            <ol><b>1. Keyword in the Title tag:</b> Title tag tells the search engine and users about your content. It provides an accurate description of the content, which makes it an important relevancy signal for a search engine. So, one can incorporate relevant keywords in the title tag that represents your content and thus can assist search engines and users in understanding what they are going to read and accordingly to improve its ranking.</ol>
            <ol><b>2. Keyword in meta description tag:</b> It is a summary or snippet of your page, which is displayed on search engine result pages below the URL.

            <ol><b>4. The length of the page:</b> Today, the users don't get satisfied with basic information; instead, they want to be educated by reading all the possible information about a topic. The search engine, therefore, prefers lengthy pages to rank first as the longer pages can cover more aspects of your topic.</ol>
            <ol><b>5. Canonical Tag:</b> You should use the canonical tag when you have two URLs with similar content. This tag prevents the issue of duplicate content as it tells Google that one URL is equivalent to another, so the two pages with the same content are not different pages and they belong to the original page.</ol>
            <ol><b>6. Image Optimization:</b> Along with the text, images should also be optimized by using alt text, caption and description, and more. Furthermore, don't name your image as 'image1.jpg' instead use descriptive filenames, for example, 'woman-driving-car.jpg.'</ol>
            <ol><b>7. Content Updates:</b> Search engines prefers freshly updated content. So, keep adding more information to the site and update the old pages if required.</ol>
            <ol><b>8. Outbound Links:</b> You can use outbound links to send users to another website if you want to provide more information. So, it can be a trust factor for Google. However, using too many outbound links many affect the rankings, so use them in moderation.</ol>
            <ol><b>9. Internal Links:</b> You can interlink your pages so that traffic from a one may be diverted to other pages which are less clicked by the users.</ol>
            <ol><b>10. Keyword in URL:</b> The URL should contain the keywords as it is also a way to send a relevancy signal to search engines.</ol>
            <ol><b>11. Sitemap:</b> You can create a Sitemap for your site. It helps search engines to index all pages on your website, which is a part of SEO.</ol>

A search engine spider follows the links found on a page, both internal and external links. If a page lacks links, the spider will read your page and go. It also helps keep users on your site for a long time.</ol>
            <ol><b>20) External Links:</b> External links can be used for SEO as they allow you to link your site to other high-quality related websites, which makes your site more trustworthy, which is good for SEO.</ol>
